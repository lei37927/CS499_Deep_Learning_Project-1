# CS499_Deep_Learning_Project-1

## Project Description
In this project our goal is to implement the gradient descent algorithm for learning a logistic regression model, and then use it with early stopping regularization to make predictions on several real data sets.

### Gradient Descent Algorithm
See our implementation of Gradient Descent Algorithm using R language [here](GradientDescent.R)
