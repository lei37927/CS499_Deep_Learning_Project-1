# CS499_Deep_Learning_Project-1

## Project Description
In this project our goal is to implement the gradient descent algorithm for learning a logistic regression model, and then use it with early stopping regularization to make predictions on several real data sets.

### Gradient Descent Algorithm
See our implementation of Gradient Descent Algorithm using R language [here](GradientDescent.R).

## How to run it
### 1.1 Environment Configuration
#### 1.1.1 Install R
Because our project is written in R language, so it is necessary to have R on your machine.

You can download R [here](https://www.r-project.org/) and install it.

#### 1.1.2 Install RStudio
This is the easiest way for everyone can run our project.

You can download RStudio [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

### 1.2 Download our project
You can use ```git clone``` to download our project or just click the green button to download ZIP.
