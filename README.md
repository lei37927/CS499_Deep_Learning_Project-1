# CS499_Deep_Learning_Project-1

## Project Description
In this project our goal is to implement the gradient descent algorithm for learning a logistic regression model, and then use it with early stopping regularization to make predictions on several real data sets.

### Gradient Descent Algorithm
See our implementation of Gradient Descent Algorithm using R language [here](GradientDescent.R).

## How to run it
### 1 Environment Configuration
#### 1.1 Install R
Because the project is written in R language, so it is necessary to have R on your machine.

You can download R [here](https://www.r-project.org/) and install it.

#### 1.2 Install RStudio
This is the easiest way for everyone can run the project.

You can download RStudio [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) and install it.

### 2 Having the project
#### 2.1 Download the project
You can use ```git clone``` to download the project or just click the green button to download a ZIP file.

#### 2.2 Unzip the project
Use any tools you like to unzip the project into the folder you want.

### 3 Run the project
#### 3.1 Set the path
***This is an important step, ignoring this may cause some problems with reading data.***
Open RStudio, in the 'console' command line at the left bottom corner, type
```
setwd('PATH')
```
where PATH is where you unzip all the R and data files.
